# Project-365

Today I am starting a very ambitious project... 365 Days of Code Challenge! Similar in nature to the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/), I will be spending a minimum of 1 hour each day of 2021 working on a personal project hopefully learning a thing or two and improving my coding abilities. I intend to work on a couple of projects, each containing elements that should push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to expand my knowledge and skill set. You can check out my plans in the video below:

It would make my day if this encourages even one person to sign up to the 100 Days Challenge. You can find out more about the challenge here: https://www.100daysofcode.com/. Reach out if you are starting a coding challenge project of your own, I'd love to check it out.

## Day 1
Spent a good couple of hours setting up and configuring Gatsby, Contentful and Netlify as the foundation to the first project.
Worked a little on bringing the exisiting navbar and landing page to the newsite with Styled-Components.


## Day 2 
Today was really a project architecture day. Starting out with project mapping, followed by creating some Contentful content types and finished up with a little component. 

## Day 3
Spent an hour today building out the footer component, making consideration on how I want to integrate this to Contentful in the near future. Also spent a little time considering a couple of features I want to implement down the road. 

## Day 4
Built out a Contentful content type for the footer and integrated it into the footer. Worked on the community section of the homepage, bringing the homepage to an almost complete state. A few tweaks and mobile quires should be enough to finish this page off. 


## Day 5
Set up Gatsby to dynamically create pages for each game server, based on the data it gets from the Contentful model. Experienced a weird issue where netlify does not appear to have the style sheet for the new page. Will investigate more tomorrow.
